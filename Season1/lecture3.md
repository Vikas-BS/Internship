Hoisting in JavaScript 

Hoisting is a concept which enables us to extract values of variables and functions even before initialising/assigning value without getting error and this is happening due to the 1st phase (memory creation phase) of the Execution Context.

The function and variable declaration are moved to the top of the scope.
